You can use the following optional arguments when calling UI++ from a command line.

<a name="config"></a>/config:&lt;filename&gt;
: The filename of the configuration file to use. This filename can include a path if necessary. If not specified, UI++ uses **ui++.xml** with no path specified.

  In addition to loading a local file, UI++ can load the configuration file from an HTTP or HTTPS location. To do this, specify the entire correct URL for the XML file including prefixing it with **http://** or *https://**. UI++ downloads the specified file from the URL to the current userâ€™s TEMP directory and then loads the file from there.

  When using this command line argument note that you can use a task sequence variable to set its value. For example, if you have multiple configuration files, you can populate a task sequence variable named **MyConfig** with the filename and then use the following command line: 
  
  ~~~
  ui++.exe /config:%MyConfig%
  ~~~

/retry:&lt;count&gt;
: If you specify an HTTP or HTTPS location for the configuration file using the **/config** argument, then this switch specifies how many times UI++ retries downloading the configuration file in the event of a file download failure. UI++ pauses for five seconds between each attempt.

/fallback:&lt;filename&gt;
: If you specify an HTTP or HTTPS location for the configuration file using the **/config** argument and the download fails, UI++ loads the file specified by this argument.

<a name="disabletsvareditor"></a>/disabletsvareditor
: If you specify this switch, UI++ disables the variable editor and the dump variables to a text file ability.
