![UI++ Sample Welcome](/assets/images/screenshots/welcome.png){: .image--floatright }

**UI++** is a dynamic, user interface (UI) generation tool. **UI++** displays information to the interactive user, solicits input from the interactive user, and then performs actions based on that user's input and selections including populating task sequence variables during System Center Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) Operating System Deployment (OSD). **UI++** also works outside of task sequences because, at its heart, **UI++** is simply a generic UI framework. It’s still great during task sequences, but its certainly not limited to them.

Nearly every aspect of **UI++** is customizable including, the number of dialogs, colors, icons, and the exact text to display — everything shown is up to you. Examples of information commonly requested from users include the system name, business unit, primary user, time zone, OU, and application selection.
